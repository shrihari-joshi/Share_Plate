            Connecting Communities Through Food
          </h3>
          <p className='content'>Welcome to SharePlates, where we believe in the power of food to unite communities and make a meaningful difference in the lives of those in need.

            Our platform serves as a bridge between NGOs and supply communities, fostering a symbiotic relationship where surplus food finds its way to those who need it the most. We are committed to facilitating the redistribution of excess food to the underserved.</p>

            Our Mission
          </h3>
          <p className='content'>
            At SharePlates, our mission is simple yet impactful: to alleviate hunger and reduce food waste by connecting generous restaurants with local NGOs dedicated to serving the community. We strive to create a seamless process where surplus food is redirected from restaurants to NGOs, and finally into the hands of individuals and families who are facing food insecurity.
          </p>
          <h3 className='headers'>How It Works</h3>
          <p className='content'>
          Easily connect NGOs and restaurants on our platform. Restaurants post surplus food details, NGOs receive real-time notifications, ensuring quick and efficient distribution to those in need.</p>

          <h3 className='headers'>The Heart of Our Operation: Volunteers</h3>
          <p className='content'>"Our dedicated volunteers, the unsung heroes, collect surplus food and deliver it to those in need. Their commitment and enthusiasm drive our mission forward, creating a ripple effect of compassion in our communities."</p>
